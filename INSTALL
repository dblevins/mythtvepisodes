Download the latest version, install next to mythfilldatabase and link
it to the name 'mythtvepisodes'.  I'll be updating the script
periodically and will keep track of version numbers etc.  Here is the
current list:

  lrwxrwxrwx    1 dblevins users          18 Mar 24 18:25 mythtvepisodes -> mythtvepisodes-1.0
  -rw-r--r--    1 dblevins users       10230 Mar 24 18:24 mythtvepisodes-1.0
  -rw-r--r--    1 dblevins users          67 Mar 24 18:29 README

The script requires the Perl DBI module to run.

Once the script is installed, run setup.

  % mythtvepisodes -setup

You can then add it to your crontab to run after mythfilldatabase. For
example:


  30 5 * * *     mythfilldatabase > /dev/null
  45 5 * * *     mythtvepisodes

Then just type -help for usage info on setting up tv shows.

  % mythtvepisodes -help

I've tested it with 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer', 'Angle', 'Futurama',
'Smallville', and 'Farscape' with good success.  Occationally the data
from epguides.com doesn't match that from XMLTV and shows get recorded
that were supposed to be skipped.  Doesn't happen very often and it's
pretty easy just to delete them afterwards.
